This MATLAB code solves a set of equations symbolically using the Symbolic Math Toolbox. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

  1. clc: Clears the command window to provide a clean workspace.
  2. clearvars: Clears all variables from the workspace.
  3. syms Kbf Kbr: Declares Kbf and Kbr as symbolic variables.
  4. l1 = 1.454;: Assigns a value of 1.454 to the variable l1.
  5. l2 = 1.289;: Assigns a value of 1.289 to the variable l2.
  6. mu = 0.9;: Assigns a value of 0.9 to the variable mu.
  7. h = 0.781;: Assigns a value of 0.781 to the variable h.
  8. fr = 0.015;: Assigns a value of 0.015 to the variable fr.
  9. eq1 = Kbf / Kbr == (l2 + h * (mu + fr)) / (l1 - h * (mu + fr));: Defines the first equation using the declared symbols and the previously assigned values.
  10. eq2 = Kbf + Kbr == 1;: Defines the second equation using the declared symbols.
  11. sol = vpasolve([eq1, eq2], [Kbf, Kbr]);: Solves the system of equations eq1 and eq2 symbolically using the vpasolve function and saves the solutions in the sol variable.

The code solves for the values of Kbf and Kbr that satisfy the given equations, where Kbf and Kbr are variables representing some parameters related to a vehicle's wheelbase and other properties.
